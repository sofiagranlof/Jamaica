				<h1>Why are our products plant-based?</h1>
				<h2>Sustanability</h2>
				<p>From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all aware<br>of ways to live a greener life. One of the most effective things an individual can<br> do to lower their carbon footprint is to avoid all animal products. This goes way<br> beyond the problem of cow flatulence!</p>
				<h3>Why is meat and diary so bad for the environment?</h3>
				<p>The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden<br>on the environment - from crops and water required to feed the animals, to the transport<br> and other processes involved from farm to fork. The vast amount of grain feed<br>required for meat production is a significant contributor to deforestation, habitat loss and<br> species extinction. In Brazil alone, the equivalent of 5.6 million acres of<br>land is used to grow soya beans for animals in Europe. This land contributes to<br>developing world malnutrition by driving impoverished populations to grow cash crops for<br>animal feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand, considerably lower<br>quantities of crops and water are required to sustain a vegan diet, making the switch to<br>veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our<br>impact on the environment. </p>
				<h2>Health </h2>
				<p>More and more people are turning to a vegan diet for the health benefits:<br> increased energy, younger looking skin and eternal youth are just some of the<br>claims from enthusiastic plant eaters. Well, eternal youth might be a bit optimistic,<br>but there are certainly many scientifically proven benefits to vegan living when compared<br>to the average western diet.</p>
				<p>Well-planned plant-based diets are rich in protein, iron, calcium and<br>other essential vitamins and minerals. The plant-based sources of these nutrients tend<br>to be low in saturated fat, high in fibre and packed with antioxidants, helping mitigate<br>some of the modern world's biggest health issues like obesity, heart disease,<br>diabetes and cancer.</p>
				<h2>Ethics</h2>
				<p> Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for becoming<br>vegan, but for many it remains the key factor in their decision to go vegan and stay vegan.<br>Having emotional attachments with animals may form part of that reason, while many believe<br>that all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. Specifics aside, avoiding animal<br>products is one of the most obvious ways you can take a stand against animal cruelty and<br>animal exploitation everywhere</p>
